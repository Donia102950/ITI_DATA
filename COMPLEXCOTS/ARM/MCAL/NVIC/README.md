**Interrupts Table from M3 Guide**![](table.png)**MISRA Rule 2.4 (advisory): Sections of code should not be “commented out”.**Where it is required for sections of source code not to be compiled then this should be achieved byuse of conditional compilation (e.g. #if or #ifdef constructs with a comment). Using start and endcomment markers for this purpose is dangerous because C does not support nested comments, andany comments already existing in the section of code would change the effect.
